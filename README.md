This is a simple Book Management System created using JSP, Hibernate, MySQL, and Bootstrap. The application allows users to manage books by adding them to a collection and viewing a list of all books already listed.

Features
- Add a Book: Users can add new books to the system by providing essential details like title, author, and genre.
- View All Books: Displays a list of all books that have already been added to the system.
  
Tech Stack
- JSP (Java Server Pages) for dynamic content rendering.
- Hibernate for object-relational mapping (ORM) to interact with the MySQL database.
- MySQL as the relational database for storing book details.
- Bootstrap for responsive front-end design.
  
How It Works
- Users can submit book details through a simple form.
- The application uses Hibernate to interact with the MySQL database and store the entered book details.
- The system also provides a view page where all previously added books are displayed.
